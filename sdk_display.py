"""
Sudoku board display. 
Designed for a simple model/view/controller architecture, 
in which the board display knows about the sudoku board, 
and not vice versa.  Communication from the sudoku board
to the board display is by event notifications through 
registered listeners. 

Displays a rectangular grid of cells, organized in rows and columns
with row 0 at the top and growing down, column 0 at the left and 
growing to the right.  A sequence of unique colors for cells can 
be chosen from a color wheel, in addition to colors 'black' and 'white'
which do not appear in the color wheel.
